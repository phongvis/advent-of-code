# advent-of-code
My code for the very interesting [Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/). Inspired by [Peter Norvig's solutions](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/blob/master/ipynb/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb), I will do similar things. First, I will redo 2016 and 2017 and put my solutions in notebooks. Of course, I will check out his great solutions to learn as well.
